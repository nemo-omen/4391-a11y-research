This study into the accessibility and usability of student-facing web pages at Angelo State University clearly reveals deficiencies that inhibit usage by students with disabilities. RamPort's higher violation severity risks excluding visually and motor impaired students from vital academic interactions and could potentially expose the university to litigation.

Observed usability challenges with intricate, overwhelming interfaces like the course registration page confirm that WCAG standards fail to address usability barriers alone. Students require inclusive universal access that meets both technical guidelines and real usability needs. Prioritizing fixes that target navigation and comprehension promises an improved experience for users in the short term. However, long-term, institutional commitment to user research is required to ensure the best experience for all users.
