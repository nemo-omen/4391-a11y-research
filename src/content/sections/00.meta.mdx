# {frontmatter.title}

I'm not sure what needs to be here. Just my name? Dr. Garrison's name? Date?

Anyway, this will be styled a little differently than the rest of the document.

__TODO__:
- [x] Citations
- [x] Citation hover cards
- [x] Works Cited Page
- [x] Switch to `.mdx` for content pages so components can be included
- [ ] Figure/Figcaption styles
- [ ] This minimal style is nice and all, but you might want something just a bit more engaging. Or not, but you really should probably figure out a header and footer (at least).

Okay, let's test out a <CitationLink href="#example-citation" title="Card Title" client:visible>Citation</CitationLink>.

And then let's test a <CitationLink href="#second-citation" title="Second Citation" client:visible>Second Citation</CitationLink>.
