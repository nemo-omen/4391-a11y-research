import CardLink from '../../components/CardLink.svelte';

# {frontmatter.title}

I'm not sure what needs to be here. Just my name? Dr. Garrison's name? Date?

Anyway, this will be styled a little differently than the rest of the document.

__TODO__:
- Citations
- Citation hover cards
- Figure/Figcaption styles
- Works Cited Page
- Switch to `.mdx` for content pages so components can be included
- This minimal style is nice and all, but you might want something just a bit more engaging. Or not, but you really should probably figure out a header and footer (at least).

This will be a test of the 
<CardLink href="#example-citation" title="Card Title" client:visible>hover card</CardLink>. I'm hoping I can make this a nice little feature for in-text citations.
