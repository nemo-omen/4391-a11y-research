## {frontmatter.title}

The U.S. federal government requires that all Title IV higher education institutions comply with specific web accessibility guidelines (WCAG) v2.0 (<a href="#citation-aria-menu-role">Taylor. 61.</a>). Nevertheless, many schools have failed to build affordances for students with disabilities into their websites, as evidenced by the more than 8,000 digital accessibility lawsuits filed against schools in federal courts between 2017 and 2020 (<a href="#citation-vu">Vu et al.</a>). In addition, more students with disabilities are choosing distance learning (<a href="citation-mullin">Mullin et al. 6.</a>). As a result, schools that fail to adhere to strict accessibility standards face an increased risk of litigation.

Through a combination of automated software tests and the subjective input of students with disabilities, this research reveals that several student-facing pages on the Angelo State University (ASU) website fail to meet accessibility standards and that those failures negatively affect students with disabilities and their ability to locate important information, register for courses, and manage their student accounts.
