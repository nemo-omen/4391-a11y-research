# Accessibility at Angelo.edu

<!-- <time>Fall 2023, Dr. Kevin Garrison, Jeff Caldwell</time> -->
I'm not sure what needs to be here. Just my name? Dr. Garrison's name? Date?

Anyway, this will be styled a little differently than the rest of the document.

__TODO__:
- Citations
- Citation hover cards
- Figure/Figcaption styles
- Works Cited Page
- Switch to `.mdx` for content pages so components can be included
- This minimal style is nice and all, but you might want something just a bit more engaging. Or not, but you really should probably figure out a header and footer (at least).
