Definitions of web accessibility have varied throughout the history of the web; however, providing an accessible and usable experience to users with disabilities has been considered essential since the platform's early development ([World Wide Web Consortium, 1997](#citation-w3c-wai)). The most popular definition, according to an industry survey ([Yesilda et al., 2012](#citation-yesilda)), was put forth by the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI), which states, "Web accessibility means that websites, tools, and technologies are designed and developed so that people with disabilities can use them" ([Web Accessibility Initiative, 2023](#citation-wai)). WAI further specifies that accessibility dictates that users should be able to perceive, understand, navigate, interact with, and contribute to the web ([Web Accessibility Initiative, 2023](#citation-wai)). While this definition focuses on users with disabilities, the International Standard Organization (ISO) offers a broader perspective, defining accessibility as "the extent to which products, systems, services, environments and facilities can be used by people from a population with the widest range of user needs" ([International Organization for Standardization, 2021](#citation-iso)). Together, these examples show that concepts of accessibility overlap with concepts of usability, which focus on how efficiently, effectively, and satisfactorily a user can complete tasks with a given application or website (World Wide Web Consortium, 2016).

As time has passed, accessibility guidelines have come to include suggestions that incorporate usability concepts ([Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0, n.d.](#citation-wcag)). However, there remains a lack of evidence that conformance to these guidelines leads to more usable websites for people with disabilities ([Power et al., 2012, p. 433](#citation-power)). One study conducted at the University of New York states that Success Criteria did not cover up to 49.6% of difficulties faced by users in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines ([Power et al., 2012, p. 438](#citation-power)). The study suggests that adherence to WCAG guidelines may be a potentially beneficial component for designing and developing inclusive websites, but conformance alone does not guarantee that a website will be accessible for users with disabilities.

This paper presents a study that answers the following empirical questions:

- To what extent do student-facing pages at Angelo.edu conform to WCAG 2.0 guidelines?
- To what extent do the accessibility and usability of those pages affect students with vision and mobility disabilities?

For the purposes of this study, the term “student-facing pages” refers specifically to web pages on the university website that provide critical functionality and services for current students. These include pages and portals that enable enrolled students to complete key administrative tasks such as registering for courses, accessing academic records and transcripts, managing financial aid, and tracking degree progress.

This research evaluated web accessibility barriers that impact users with vision disabilities through an approach that incorporated multiple methods. Automated accessibility audits measured compliance with technical guidelines that benefit those using screen readers, while an in-person usability study enlisted student participants with vision disabilities to complete common tasks using assistive technologies. Their feedback provided critical insights into real-world challenges not fully addressed by guideline compliance alone.

Additionally, while mobility disabilities were not necessarily represented among the test subjects, all encountered interaction difficulties stemming from reliance on keyboard rather than mouse input for navigation. By focusing analysis on both standards compliance and representative users who predominantly depend on keyboard control, this study aimed to uncover obstacles across key populations who face accessibility and usability challenges in web environments.

Quantifying violations and qualitatively showcasing struggles provides Angelo State administrators with actionable insights that prioritize beneficial remedies for current and prospective students. The choice by administrators to embed inclusiveness into protocols surrounding the design and implementation of critical service infrastructurerepresented by the website would signal a meaningful commitment to addressing systemic barriers for disabled users over checklist compliance. While additional progress would remain imperative, self-initiated auditing would signify awareness and willingness to incrementally enhance accessibility. This user-informed approach, combined with roadmaps for remediation lessens the potential exposure should legal threats materialize.
