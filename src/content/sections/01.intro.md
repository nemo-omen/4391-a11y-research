## Introduction

This will be a description of the problem: that there are multiple pages served on the non-public sections of the angelo.edu domain that are not accessible to students with disabilities.

Within this introduction, it's probably a good idea to cite various lawsuits and statistics from the past decade. Litigation is a strong motivator!

The other thing to include here is a summary of the findings (should that have its own subsection?) and the experiences of the test subjects.

### Methods

This will be a description of the methods used to undertake this research and why they were chosen.

1. Comprehensive automated analysis of non-public pages.
2. Manual analysis of "archetype" pages.
3. Usability testing with subjects who have disabilities.
