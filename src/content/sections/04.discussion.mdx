Over the course of usability testing, several patterns emerged that may help illuminate barriers faced by students with disabilities. Consistent issues experienced by all three participants may provide insight into obstacles impacting a broader range of users. Of special interest is the fact that subjects spent relatively little time navigating RamPort while completing Task 3. This suggests that, while RamPort accounted for the highest number of accessibility violations, subjects faced relatively few usability problems when using the page. Instead, subjects spent the most time trying to navigate and understand the Banner Self Service class lookup table (Figure 4).
The class lookup table consists of 20 columns of information that users must navigate one cell at a time in sequence because of how screen readers operate. In testing, every subject expressed frustration at the difficulty of understanding where they were on the page, with one student summarizing the table as “an abundance of interaction,” and “absolutely overwhelming.”

It should be noted that Subject 3, the only subject to complete the registration task without assistance, was the subject who simulated blindness through the use of an eye-covering. The subject suggested that their ability to complete the task was largely because they could approach the class lookup table with a previously constructed mental model from having seen it before the test. Neither Subject 1 nor Subject 2 had ever interacted with the lookup table before testing, and both stated that they instead enlisted outside assistance to register for classes.

During debriefing interviews, most subjects expressed a preference for or desire to complete tasks like class registration without the need for outside assistance. Subjects who preferred this autonomy suggested that their negative experiences while interacting with student-facing pages were the primary reason for needing assistance. The most specific feedback came from Subject 1, who stated, "I have to tab through everything and try to keep in mind where I'm at, so it was just easier to have my advisor do it."
