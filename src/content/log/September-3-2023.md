### Additional Pages to Test

While exploring more of the site, I decided to run [Axe DevTools](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/axe-devtools/) on a few pages that don't fall under the RamPort domain. These included the RamPort login page, the [MyAccount](https://aic.angelo.edu/AIssue/Self/) page, the [MyPassword](https://mypassword.angelo.edu/Login.aspx?ReturnUrl=%2f) page, and the [Publick Knowledge - Using MyPassword Service](https://angelostate.servicenowservices.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0010286&sys_kb_id=62b1d388dbd08d1047e8818a1396193c&spa=1) page. All of them had multiple accessibility problems.

These pages are fundamental to a student's ability to establish an account,  recover an account, or access documentation about the technology connected to their account.

Because they're so central to a student's ability to access RamPort, I'm going to include them as part of automated testing.

### A More Robust Study

It occurred to me that doing two sets of usability tests would make the research more robust. Currently, the plan is to assess the usability of the site for students with vision or mobility disabilities only. The study could be more robust, and possibly more suited to academia, with the addition of a comparitive study of non-disabled students.

I'll bring this up with Dr. Garrison during our next meeting.

### The Possibility of Future Collaboration

I'm enrolled in [CS 4306 - Software Engineering](https://angelo.campusconcourse.com/view_syllabus?course_id=8093). The course is a practical introduction to the processes of developing complex software for clients. Students are presented with problems faced by several real businesses and, in small teams, build a piece of software to address those needs.

I wonder if there's a possibility to create some kind of collaboration between the Computer Science department, the English/Technical Communications department, and ASU IT.
