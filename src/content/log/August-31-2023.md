I spent some time this morning adding hover cards to in-text citations. This will allow a given citation to appear near the link for in in-text citation when the user hovers over the link.

Dr. Garrison emailed yesterday afternoon with his certificate for completion of the CITI IRB training. I plan to have the same training finished before the end of the coming weekend. I would also like to have a tentative outline for the final document/presentation. I can use this as a roadmap for conducting the research.
