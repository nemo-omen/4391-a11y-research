## IRB approval and a potential new project name

### IRB Approval

Dr. Garrison submitted the paperwork for IRB approval on my behalf on Friday, September 15. We can't move forward with the usability testing portion of this project until our plan is approved by the review board. Once we've passed the review process, we can start recruiting subjects, which will present its own challenges. First, we're trying to select subjects from a small subset of students at Angelo State. Second, we don't have any incentives to offer them outside of the prospect of (Possibly? Hopefully?) improving the accessibility of the site for students in the future. Maybe I should order some t-shirts that say "I helped fix the school's website for disabled students and all I got was this stupid t-shirt."

### New Project Name??

I think I may change the name of the project to "A11y.Edu - an analysis of the accessibility and usability of Angelo.edu subdomains." I like "A11y.Edu" more than "A11yCrwlr." It sounds better and it's meaning is more obvious. Another option is "Accessibility.Edu," which is even more obvious.

### VPN access

I finally received approval for VPN access to the testing environment of [ramport.angelo.edu](https://ramport.angelo.edu). I was planning to start real development of the crawler this weekend, but the test environment for RamPort times out when I try to connect to it through the VPN. Hopefully I can troubleshoot that problem and get started on development. I don't want to reach the middle of the semester and get overwhelmed.
