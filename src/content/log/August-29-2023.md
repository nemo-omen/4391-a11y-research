Met with Dr. Garrison via Webex late this morning. We discussed defining the scope of the project and took the time to define the methods we'll use for the project. Most of the meeting was dedicated to planning how we'll get IRB approval before we can move ahead with research involving human subjects.

This project will require two phases of data collection. The first phase will consist of crawling the student-facing pages at angelo.edu and running automated accessibility tests on each one. Results from each test will be compiled into an overall assessment of the site's accessibility with details for each variation of page type, depending on the service or vendor in question.

Usability tests will make up the second phase of data collection. These tests will involve users with vision or mobility disabilities undertaking tasks on the site and reporting their experiences in what's called the "think aloud" method. With this method, we hope to get insight into user's levels of frustration.

The next week will be devoted to drafting and submitting the necessary forms for IRB approval. I'll also spend some time planning and, possibly, writing some preliminary code so I'm prepared for the automated testing phase.
